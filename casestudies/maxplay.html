                    <h1>Designing a 3D Editor</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>In Q4 of 2015 I was contracted for 3 months to complete the 2nd product iteration on a 3D game development platform application called GDS (Game Development Suite), created by MaxPlay. The 1st product iteration was not released publicly, but it has been used to develop several in-house iOS &amp; Android  games to pique  interest within the gaming community prior to going to market. <br /><br />Applications such as Unreal and Unity have had a firm grasp in the game development space for over 10 years so reflecting the needs of the users as well as seeing how it fits into a broader business strategy was crucial to the success of the product. The first version was lacking in a number areas such as not having a comprehensive visual system, as well as poor competitor differentiation. I was brought in to design a new user interface, as well as create the foundational visual language that would guide their product iterations in the future.</p>

                <h1>Forming an Approach</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                
                <p>It became obvious early-on that with as many product owners and users involved, it would be best to go through the process of narrowing down our aesthetic preferences, and to iterate continually throughout so that by the time we reach a high-fidelity design, we had already solved many of the the biggest issues together.<br /><br />However, the job of the UI design team is to not just satisfy everyone’s personal preferences, but to take it into consideration as we push the boundaries of the project.</p>

                <h2>Problem Definition</h2>
                
                <p>The MaxPlay interface from version 1, as sufficient as it is as a video game development platform, lacks a cohesive visual system in order to convey higher level functionality. Functionality such as displaying active collaborators as well as advanced customization.<br /><br />These things can make the interface appear more personal to a group of people who pride themselves on customizing/hacking their experiences. Additionally, MaxPlay needs to have an interface that fits into the marketplace, but also differentiates in a strong way when compared to competitors. </p>

                <h2>Guidelines</h2>
                
                <p class="guideline">The interface was to be built primarily for Windows users in low-light environments as is the case with their primary user-base, indie developers and AAA-studio production teams.</p>
                
                <p class="guideline">Being able to customize the interface to a high degree is critical to many users since the application is competing with established user interfaces from Unity and UnReal which permit varying degrees of control to the user.</p>

                <p class="guideline">Needed to create a visual system that could accommodate hundreds of screens and scenarios while still fitting into a larger digital ecosystem which included the MaxPlay marketing website as well as MaxPlay web portal experience.</p>

                <p>After talking to Shaun and Maggie over the phone we worked out arrangements for the project, and I sent over a proposal detailing all the great work we would do together over 3 months.
                Creating a project plan always starts on TeamGannt and allows me to piece together all of the elements necessary in an engagement.</p>

                <h1>Digging into Inspiration</h1>
                <h2 class="overview">Overview</h2>
                <p class="overview">Getting a strong sense of what the product owners are expecting in the interface design is really important long before we ever start designing any of the actual screen assets. Furthermore, design is so much more about effective communication than it is anything else. Inspiration processes and explorations are intended to communicate back to the group the things that you’ve listened and that you've understood the project needs and problems. Through that you arrive at solutions to insightful questions.  </p>

                <div class="right-50">
                    <h2>Moodboard</h2> 
                    <p>My primary approach to nailing down the aesthetic for MaxPlay was by first taking into serious consideration the work already completed by both Shaun and Maggie since much of what they created was built on user research and consensus from the rest of the company.<br /><br />
                    By referencing much of Shaun’s Pinterest in addition to collecting my own resources was I able to create a Moodboard that framed the discussion around what Maxplay is or isn’t, but with the added benefit of an aesthetic comparison to MaxPlay competitors from a variety of angles.</p>

                <img class="align-img-center" src="/img/maxplay-study/moodboardpreso@2x.png" alt="Presentation Slides">

                <h2>Style Tile</h2>
                <p class="style-tile">Once the Moodboard had been narrowed to a few options, it was still important to the team that we explore as many different combinations of opacity and tone so that we can see scalability of the visual language that we were creating. By referencing much of the Moodboard examples, I was better able to narrow down typography, color palette, and many other attributes which lead to more concise discussions around aesthetic. </p>

                <h1>Design Explorations</h1>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Allowing for exploration early on in the process is very important, but even more critical is  making it clear what specifically it is we’re solving, and framing that discussion constructively. This is key to having productive discussions around an interface’s aesthetic. Being able to deliver on multiple “looks” requires focusing on one specific screen in the screen inventory and strategically differentiating them from one another in order to simultaneously move forward as well as retain consensus from the style tiles.</p>


                <h2>Exploration Round 1</h2>
                <p>Goal of this exploration was to get a sense of the team’s sensibilities as we start to put all of the different aesthetical pieces together. Getting a strong sense of how these directions stack up against competitors as well as the previous iteration was key in understanding where to take the interface visually. Narrowing down elements such as buttons, menus, legibility, and general look &amp; feel were a focus here. Being able to throw a number of different styles and looks is important to creating the right conversation.

                <h2>Exploration Round 2</h2>
                <p>Feedback from the previous round included continuing to address the contrast of the dark interface, that the lighter tonal version was preferred by users, and that the editor tabs needed to be connected to the background. Also we needed to make the margins between the modules much more compact and tight so that screen real estate is maximized while leaving enough room for eye-tracking.</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p class="overview">At this point in the process, we’ve narrowed down the general look and feel by presenting 2 aesthetic extremes with a conservative 3rd option. Setting up our discussions around these types of designs allows for me to gain a super clear picture on what’s resonating with the product owners and users.

                    <h2>Brand Heavy Direction</h2>
                    <p>This first direction, I wanted the aesthetic to really reflect the greens and blues of the marketing brand guide while using transparency fairly heavily. Still being able to use depth and opacity in addition to the strong color palette is  a key distinguishing feature.</p>

                    <h2>Toned-Up Direction</h2>
                    <p>For this direction, the goal was simple. To create a direction that had as much opacity as possible while delivering on a multi-tonal background to re-emphasize those attributes. Additionally, I played around with shadowing and adding depth to important buttons to make them more noticeable on the interface.

Provided the transparency of the modules and that the blue color can be modified in the settings, this was the consensus amongst the product owners and users.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>After we had worked our way through the design direction phase, and had come to a consensus on a version of the design, we took a second-look at the remaining screens to be completed over the course of the engagement and determined that using a somewhat modified sprint-based design schedule would be best in order to continue getting strong consensus amongst all product owners and stakeholders. This allowed us to get the iterations necessary on higher priority screens while still continuing to flesh out as much of the interface as possible.

                <h2>Setting Expectations</h2>
                <p>Being a UI only project, you really have to advocate for getting insight into the research behind the product in addition to making changes based on that research so it was important to establish the bounds of that interaction. Initially, we wanted to be able to conduct as many user interviews as possible, but seeing as how Maggie is such an integral part of the team, conducting her own interviews almost everyday, I agreed to meeting with her personally to get a download of each week. This proved good for our working relationship in addition to the project.<br /><br />Weekly deliverable would include a round of designs with the expectation that certain parts of the UI would require more exploration than others.

                <h2>Getting Qualitative User Feedback</h2>
                <p>Overall goal was to not only deliver on the expectations of the client (Maxplay), but also try my best as the UI designer to keep track of all the different changes that occur at the UX level along the way. By using Invision, Maggie (UX Design) had invited quite a few of MaxPlay’s internal game development studio team in order to get real feedback from users as we were contemplating different solves in the interface. By keeping track of these changelists and comments, we were able to have more productive weekly check-in meetings.</p>
                <h2>Tracking Feedback Inventory</h2>
                <p>Each week working through dozens of new screens, each with their own effect on the interface, and working them into a cohesive visual system consisting of hundreds of components is a lot of mental heavylifting. By being able to quickly propagate changes to all screens through Sketch symbols &amp; styles  as well as being able to document each round and how it relates to that specific deliverable via Google spreadsheets, was a huge lifesaver.</p>

                    <h3>Modularity</h3>
                    <p>For the MaxPlay UI to work for such a wide variety of users and edgecases, all rules of the interface needed to be contained within a flexible module or pane. This meant keeping a consistent navigation system, margins, padding, and typography while still following the core of what was present in the wireframes. </p>

                    <h3>Color Usage</h3>
                    <p>MaxPlay has a wide array of colors at their disposal per their brand, but they are very strongly focused on the green and blue colors. However, only one of those colors can be a dominant trait in the UI, and it needed to take on extreme importance as to not take away from the task-at-hand. <br /><br />The usage of color following most active states in the UI, would be reserved for the avatars of users currently working on individual layers, objects, and projects. This blue color is meant to continually represent a logged in MaxPlay user and the actions that they are taking.</p>

                    <h3>Opacity</h3>
                    <p>Being able to play with opacity, and still have legible text over the top was a huge benefit to the developers and designers who are used to working in low-light environments. Being able to move modules across screen over other modules made it necessary that a system for opacity be developed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Information Density</h3>
                    <p>Shifting between different font sizes, margin, and padding was important in order to show that the modules had a consistent relationship despite being embiggened or being made smaller through the preferences settings. No matter what font size you chose, the on-screen information density would adapt in a relative way. </p>

                    <h3>Airtight Grid</h3>
                    <p>Much of the margin and padding established in the MaxPlay UI is proportional to each other through the use of a custom grid created in Sketch. This allowed for me to create a consistent vertical rhythm by extending grid proportions down into things like tab height, line height, font size and others.

                <h1>Style Guide</h1>
                <h2>Determining the Guide Elements</h2>
                <p>While working through the production phase, we slowly start to build up a collection of UI assets which inform much of what the Style Guide will contain. Then once the Style Guide process has started, we should have a basis to our questions about states as well as the flexibility of some of the UI decisions we've already established.<br /><br /> Our focus then becomes to extend the visual language as much as possible while "locking" in the others that have already been created.</p>

                <p class="pullout">Being able to get exact dimensions or pull off consistent information off of the style guide is critical in conveying the exact behavior of the interface. By using Sketch Measure, I reveal values for typography treatments, margins, padding, shape dimensions, and many others so that there’s less guesswork for the development team.
